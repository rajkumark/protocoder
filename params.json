{"name":"Protocoder","tagline":"","body":"Protocoder\r\n==========\r\n\r\nProtocoder is a coding environment + framework in Javascript for quick prototyping on Android devices having some enfansis on rapid hardware hacking. \r\n\r\nIt all started during the http://www.makewithmoto.com tour. A 5 month cross country roadtrip across the US with a fearless crew from Motorola ATAP on a velcro-covered van and a VW bus full of 3d printers, hackable phones, arduinos, ioios, electronics components. \r\nDuring the roadtrip we hacked together with university students and hackerspaces fellows and we realized we needed a better tool for prototyping, which we decided to start coding during the trip. Protocoder has been developed inside cars, hotel lobbys, cafes, restaurants, parks, here and there.\r\n\r\nInstall the app in your Android device and access the web IDE from your computer. \r\nCode in javascript using the protocoder framework. No needs to write dozends of lines to access sensors or write an UI, simple to use, fast to code.\r\n\r\n```\r\n//how to get sensor data\r\nsensors.startAccelerometer(function(x, y, z)) { \r\n\tconsole.log(x + \" \" + \" \" + y + \" \" + z); \r\n}\r\n\r\n//send and sms\r\nandroid.sendSMS(number, \"text\");\r\n\r\n//play a video\r\nui.addVideoView(\"fileName\", 0, 0, 500, 200);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt uses a webserver and a websockets server inside the project to do some of the magic and has support of most android hardware functionality, networking using OSC and websockets and audio synthesis and processing using Pure Data. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAndroidApp \r\n----------\r\nContains Protocoder android app, the framework in the JInterface folder and the web IDE inside the asset folder\r\n\r\n\r\nDesktopApp\r\n----------\r\nis the app companion for USB support. It is based on node-webkit and basically runs a set of adb commands to forward the connections to USB. At the moment only it only has Mac OS X support. Other platforms are welcome!\r\n\r\nHow to compile \r\n--------------\r\nClone the project, import it in eclipse, make sure the API version you are using to compile is 18 or greater. Eclipse tends to change it when importing projects. \r\nPress compile et voila.","google":"UA-45674106-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
